# Background Remover

A web-based application that removes backgrounds from images using image processing techniques. Built with Python Flask and modern web technologies.

## Features

-**Background Removal**: Remove backgrounds from any image using image processing

-**Web-Based Interface**: User-friendly interface accessible through any browser

-**Download Support**: Easily download processed images in PNG format

-**Real-Time Processing**: See the results immediately after upload

-**Supports Multiple Image Formats**: Compatible with JPEG, PNG, and other common image formats

## Technology Stack

-**Backend**: Python Flask

-**Frontend**: HTML5, JavaScript (Vanilla)

-**Image Processing**: Pillow

-**Data Handling**: Base64 encoding for image transfer

-**Development**: RESTful API architecture

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

gitclonehttps://github.com/yourusername/Background-Remover.git

cdBackground-Remover

```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

pipinstallflaskpillow

```

3. Run the application:

```bash

pythonmain.py

```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

```

http://localhost:5100

```

## How It Works

1. User uploads an image through the web interface
2. The image is processed server-side using image processing algorithms
3. Processed image is converted to base64 and sent back to the client
4. User can preview and download the processed image

## Technical Details

-**RESTful API Endpoints**:

-`GET /`: Main upload page

-`POST /download`: Process image and return base64 data

-`GET /download_page`: Download page for processed images

-**Image Processing Flow**:

- Image upload handling
- Background processing using image segmentation
- Base64 encoding/decoding
- Client-side image preview and download

## Key Implementation Features

- Error handling and validation
- Asynchronous image processing
- Efficient image data transfer
- Cross-browser compatibility
